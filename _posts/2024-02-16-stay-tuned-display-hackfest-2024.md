Igalia is preparing the 2024 Linux Display Next Hackfest and we are thrilled to
announce that this year's hackfest will take place from May 14th to 16th at our
HQ in A Coru√±a, Spain.

This unconference-style event aims to bring together the most relevant players
in the Linux display community to tackle current challenges and chart the
future of the display stack.

Key goals for the hackfest include:

- **Releasing the power of collaboration:** We'll work to remove bottlenecks
  and pave the way for smoother, more performant displays.
- **Problem-solving powerhouse:** Brainstorming sessions and collaborative
  coding will target issues like HDR, color management, variable refresh rates,
  and more.
- **Building on past commitments:** Let's solidify the progress made in recent
  years and push the boundaries even further.

The hackfest fosters an intimate and focused environment to brainstorm, hack,
and design solutions alongside fellow display experts. Participants will dive
into discussions, tinker with code, and contribute to shaping the future of the
Linux display stack.

More details are available on [the official website](https://events.pages.igalia.com/linuxdisplaynexthackfest/).

Stay tuned! Keep an eye out for more information, mark your calendars and start
prepping your hacking gear.
