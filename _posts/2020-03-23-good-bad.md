I finished my last post talking about a patch to fix the XRGB operation in
compute crc function (VKMS).

[PATCH] drm/vkms: use bitfield op to get xrgb on compute crc

I was waiting for the community feedback and I received a review with good
suggestions to simplify the solution. Unfortunatelly, despite the correct and
useful guidance, the comment was really rude.
What is the necessity of someone to give this kind of opinion? This behavior
have no benefits, for who send, who receive and for the community.

This kind of approach is able to discourage new developers. I know the community
has much more skilled and experienced people than me, but people get older, just
as they can passed away any time... who will be to support the project
continuity?

In short, unnecessary.
