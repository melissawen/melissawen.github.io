I'm a Computer Science MSc student at the Institute
of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo
[(IME-USP)](https://www.ime.usp.br/).
I holds a BSc in Computer Science in 2012 at the Federal University of Bahia
[(UFBA)](https://www.ufba.br/), where
I have also served as a temporary professor of numerical analysis.

Before starting my MSc Studies I have worked using and developing different
free software project.
I have coordinated the front-end team to develop
[the Software Publico Brasileiro portal](https://softwarepublico.gov.br/)
and I was a front-end developer of
[the Noosfero social networking platform](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Noosfero)
at [Colivre](http://colivre.coop.br/).
In 2013, I also participated in the  [Outreach Program For Women](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember),
contributing to Gedit/GNOME project - see [my posts in my old blog](https://wenfoss.wordpress.com/).

In 2019, I became part of the [FLUSP](https://flusp.ime.usp.br/) group
and started to learn how contribute to the Linux kernel project.
I still have basic development skills and I am contributing to the
IIO Subsystem and now the DRM susbystem.

The research project of my MSc studies is about
the Linux Kernel Development and Community.
My areas of interest include Software
Engineering and Free Software Development.
