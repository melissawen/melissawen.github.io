I recently start to contribute to the Linux Kernel project, more specifically to the IIO subsystem.

I'm a Computer Science MSc student at the Institute
of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IME-USP).
I holds a BSc in Computer Science from Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), where
I have also served as a temporary professor.

I worked on the SPB project as
a senior developer and was core developer of Noosfero social networking
platform at Colivre. I also contributed to the GNOME project in the context
of Outreach Program For Women.

My areas of interest include Software
Engineering and Free Software Development.
